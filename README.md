# HHKB Trainer

A little Python 3 script that I wrote for myself to get used to typing with the
Happy Hacking Keyboard Professional 2. Coming from the Poker 2.

The program will **prompt you for a key and you have to hit that key**. Yes,
really, that's it. If you get the key wrong, you will hear a "ding" sound to
indicate that you've messed up.

I've only tested this on OS X.

## It crashed and now my CLI is messed up!

```bash
$ python
>>> import curses
>>> exit()
```
